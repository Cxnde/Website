      <p> We are a diverse team of engineering indivduals from UCSD set out to develop the next generation of solutions and fun products to the every-day at home consumer. We envision ourselves comming together to use our expertise to create an affordable yet useful desk robot that could provide interaction to the customer. We began by understanding that many people may be forced to spend a lot of time at their home offices, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially we saw this as a crisis for some people mental health as they may miss having somene to talk to with some sort of feedback. We started to think what would make it fun and playful, so provide joy - first called TheraBot. We quickly learned that this may come off as a medic device for those who are seeking an autonomous therapist and figured we could generalize this a bit more by incorporating more friend-like features, such as a blend between sassiness and motivational. So far we have lots of ideas interms of usefulness, and how we can add to the functionality into everyday lives - even with thoughts of replacing some menial tasks in some workplaces, like hospice care. For the purpose of our 10 week project timeline, we would like to deliver a working prototype with proof of concept to demonstrate that we can research, build, and understand an addressable market in the real world. </p>
