      <h1> BotBuddy </h1>
      <p> Our team is dedciated to building the next generation cute & friend-like desk robot. We are aiming to develop a product that engages and interacts with the user with different emotions, depending on the users' feeling and responses, and also if they would like to choose a specific emotional setting. Initially our product was created at the idea that folks working from home may become lonely, or need some sorts of companion; thus, we decided creating a robot that lives on your desk, and can act like a friend with a variability in responses, would be a neat toy to have. All-in-all, BotBuddy will work in making the user distracted, and in hope make them happy for shorts amount of time. Our device will essentially work by allowing the user to select emotion settings, and take in an audio, convert the speech to text so it can process key words, and designate the appropriate responses; all of which is aimed at making a seemless interaction between BotBuddy and the user. The key benefits to BotBuddy would be that it is fully customaizeble from the responses down to the external casings of it, we think it will be a hot product because the user can be entertained with it at multiple stages of it. We have even thought of selling it as an unbuilt product so it can be put together like a lego kit.  </p>

      <p> Key Value Proposition
          Our desktop humanoid robot helps, primarily work-at-home adults, and all ages of people who want a social and learning experience by avoiding costly and complicated robots on the market and opting for an easy-to-use/build interaction toy that can promote learning and daily satisfaction via conversation, unlike Moxie and Milko 3 which are expensive. We believe our customers will build a connection with their BotBuddy by having to build their robot in a simple manner, and also have customability features after being completed. Most toys of this manner typically become stale, and won't be used over a period of time, thus fading out; we would like to keep the user interested with the BotBuddy via add ons and other features that continue to keep the custopmer happy. We were formally names TheraBot, but needed to generalize because it came off too therapuerdic.
