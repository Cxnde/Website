      <div class='separator'>About our product</div>
      <p> Our team is dedciated to building the next generation cute & friend-like desk robot. We are aiming to develop a product that engages and interacts with the user with different emotions, depending on the users' feeling and responses, and also if they would like to choose a specific emotional setting. Initially our product was created at the idea that folks working from home may become lonely, or need some sorts of companion; thus, we decided creating a robot that lives on your desk, and can act like a friend with a variability in responses, would be a neat toy to have. All-in-all, BotBuddy will work in making the user distracted, and in hope make them happy for shorts amount of time. Our device will essentially work by allowing the user to select emotion settings, and take in an audio, convert the speech to text so it can process key words, and designate the appropriate responses; all of which is aimed at making a seemless interaction between BotBuddy and the user. The key benefits to BotBuddy would be that it is fully customaizeble from the responses down to the external casings of it, we think it will be a hot product because the user can be entertained with it at multiple stages of it. We have even thought of selling it as an unbuilt product so it can be put together like a lego kit.  </p>

      <div class='separator'>User Interface</div>
      <p>At each stage, we would always like to encorporate the "Laws of UI Design." </p> 
      <p> Here is how we intend to start: </p>
      <p> Delivering a fully configurable BotBuddy would be optimal. We understand there is many variation is wants and needs from our customers, along with skillset, so we would like to be able to address this as much as possible throughout the full use of BotBuddy to ensure it's success, and prolong it's life expectancy with the user. From the outside, personalizing the visual aesthetic is a big thing, so we would like to have many variations in the outer shell casing, perhaps some that may match the annual seasons, thus allowing the user to have a connection to the decorational looks of BotBuddy. Full custom-ability may be a bit complex, which is why we will strive for simplicity, as a default, to match the needs of those who just want something that simply works, this would help make the product comfortable for the user and reduce cognitive load. With the app, we must combine readability, usefulness, context, and ease of use. This can be achieved in a multitude of ways such as reading the users mood via speech-to-text to pick up key words and suggest a BotBuddy mood. Consistency in color throughout the design could help with accessibility issues. Our goal is to satisfy the customer, so we will provide many ways in which they can smile and have fun with BotBuddy, so they can remember how much happiness they get at peak moments; the use of LEDs will enable us to showcase animation at specific times to make it more intriguing, for instance like different facial expressions and when logging off.  </p>

      <div class='separator'>Product Costs</div>
        <p> We are striving for affordability. For our protoype, we are using a RaspberryPi 4, which makes up a large portion of the costs. Other materials we are using include: a small speaker, a microphone, 2 matrix LED, and a 3D printed casing. Considering most of these were parts we had laying around, our raw material costs were less than ~$50. To keep the costs to build our final product, we would want to use a custom manufactured printed circuit board, along with laser-cut wood or plastic casings. This would all be part of the BotBuddy starter kit, since we would still want a deliverable product. With the adjustmenst made, we would aim to get below the $30 mark for raw material costs. </p>
      
      <div class='separator'>Revenue Model</div>
        <p> BotBuddy can be purchased in retail stores, and directly from our online website. Initially we planned for a one-time purchase of $89.99 with no subscription model; but then, we realized this was a missed opportunity. We have introduced an optional subscription model for custom designed faceplates. In this way we can offer a variety or new looks to the user according to the seasons, like halloween and christmas themes. This will also give us an opportunity for users to submit their own creative designs to be sold to other users at scale across the globe, or their favorite famous designer when we start to do collaborations. We have learned that the possibilities are endless when it comes to subscription based models because at a small fee per user, we can keep a large consistent stream of cash comming in. </p>
        <p> When we considered the pandemic analytics of COVID-19 forcing many to work remotely, we estimated ~50 million employees and students. If we aimed to reach 00.01% of this demographic in the first year with sales in retail and online, we could expect promising success; $450,000 in revenue which would make for $300,000 in profit! This is not including the newly added subscription model, which we forsee to be a bigger success that the product itself, as we can make more easily and rapidly accomodate subscribed users. </p>
