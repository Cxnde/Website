      <div class='separator'>About our product</div>
      <p> Our team is dedciated to building the next generation cute & friend-like desk robot. We are aiming to develop a product that engages and interacts with the user with different emotions, depending on the users' feeling and responses, and also if they would like to choose a specific emotional setting. Initially our product was created at the idea that folks working from home may become lonely, or need some sorts of companion; thus, we decided creating a robot that lives on your desk, and can act like a friend with a variability in responses, would be a neat toy to have. All-in-all, BotBuddy will work in making the user distracted, and in hope make them happy for shorts amount of time. Our device will essentially work by allowing the user to select emotion settings, and take in an audio, convert the speech to text so it can process key words, and designate the appropriate responses; all of which is aimed at making a seemless interaction between BotBuddy and the user. The key benefits to BotBuddy would be that it is fully customaizeble from the responses down to the external casings of it, we think it will be a hot product because the user can be entertained with it at multiple stages of it. We have even thought of selling it as an unbuilt product so it can be put together like a lego kit.  </p>
