      <div class='separator'>How we have innovated</div>
      <p> Throughout the process we have had to make a couple of pivots to make the best of our product!</p>
      <p> Where we started: </p>
        <p> We were initially only thinking about remote workers who would be lonely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then we thought since it would be "Therabot," we could expand it's implementations for medical use and therapuetic uses. We imaged it being perfect for hospice care patients that may need a companion when alone in bed. Initially we had no idea how this would really work or sell, but we wanted to design something specifically to prevent people from being sad at lonely times. We had not thought too much about the revenue model, or the extent of its functionality. </p>
      <p> Currently: </p>
        <p> After surveying around, we got a better idea how to make more universal use of, now formerly Therabot. Therabot had the wrong connotation, but the right idea! Instead of targetting customers with a direct therapeutic goal, we understood that this could make some feel self conscious of needing to feel wanted or that they may be having issues of some sort. To avoid this, we rebranded to BotBuddy, a more friendly, cute and sometimes sassy desk robot. Aside from living soley at one spot, we learned it would be great for the user to be able to have afforadility,  portability, and personailation. To achieve this, we have encorporated an option for an unbuilt easy to put together package. Additionally with the variation of face plates. We thought this would allow for the customer to grow some attachment to their new toy, and be able to keep updating the aesthetic. The easy to change face plates will be beneficial to our company because we have found that we could sell specific designs as the seasons change, or even establish a renting/buy back program. Having customizeable software will be key for the varying ages groups we are now targetting. Being that it would be more fun to use BotBuddy throughout a long extended period of time, we see more success in being able to address more of the customers' needs. We still have lots of ideas we would like to expand on!</p>
      <p> In the future: </p>
        <p> Expanding our revenue model would probably be the next step for us, after establishing a great working product. Currently it is only one device that works by itself, but if we could find a way to get BotBuddies to mingle with eachother, we could open up a whirlwing of exciting problems. Aside from offering exterior aesthetic changes, it would be awesome to be able to sell sensor kits and other extras that the user may find useful, like a camera or a temperature sensor. With the addition of so many options, we would slowly build a unique community of BotBuddies. We believe alexa at times can be a bit bland in its features, so in the future, if we could have sensors easily added and programmable, the user can build their ideal BotBuddy to do whatever they want, along with the comedic interactions we have already done! Imagine asking BotBuddy to lock your car out in the driveway, and it replies with something funny like, "I'll do it for you this time, but next time you oughta not forget!" Ideally, in the future we are hoping to be immediately responsive to the customers needs. </p>
