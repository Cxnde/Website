      <p> Here we would like to keep an updated page as we introduce new ideas so it will be easy to distinguish how BotBuddy can benedit you in your life! </p>
      
      <div class='separator'>Features vs. Benefits</div>
      <p> The overall benefit of having a BotBuddy is to make the user intertained and happy, especially at those lonely and boring times. We envision it could be a easy to use distraction where you can learn and grow with BotBuddy. Having a hardware product, rather than most modern day phone apps will be a cool uniqueness, especially at its price point. Having one BotBuddy in the house will be so much fun, you'll be eager for more! </p>
      
      <p> Top 5 features: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> LED matrix screen to display BotBuddy facial expressions corresponding to the user selected mood as well as a way to display text information like weather or a motivational message, without having to fully interact with it - like a sleep mode. </li>
        <li> Speech recognition that will work smooth, congigurable to different languages. Useful for impaired users with accessibility troubles, and ease of use. Could be programmed with other devices to do an action on commands. </li>
        <li> One of a kind speech synthehsis, to interact with a corresponding emotion after detecting key words in the users' response, for a more human & friend like interaction. Super fun! </li>
        <li> Simple, and easy-to-use app allowing for users of all age to configure BotBuddy to their needs - work or school. User can add features, for instance wanting to practice math facts, multiplication and division. </li>
        <li> Compact design. Fully buildable & customaizable. Allowing for special exterior aesthetic and built to features the user would like to incorporate, so it can fit perfectly in their home/work enviroment! </li>
      </ol>
      
      <div class='separator'>Product Interactions</div>
        <p> Some key interactions we will offer with BotBuddy are speech recognition, speech synthesis, interactive talking back, and a mobile app. Speech recognition and synthesis would be our key to making BotBuddy come to life, and having more human like interactions, compared to most robotic devices on the market. BotBuddy will be responsive with its own emotional responses after detecting what the user is feeling; perhaps talking faster to showcase excitment, and even get louder when it is mad or happy. One of our constraints at the moment is having the user speak clearly so BotBuddy can understand each word. Additionally we will have a useful app where the customer can choose a designated BotBuddy mood for consistentcy. In this app, the user can be interactive with their BotBuddy by adding responses, designate moods, and a whole lot more features. We would like this product to resemble a modern day lego like kit, where you can build, and continue to add onto it for the extent of its life! The whole idea is to be interactive with the user, so we will ensure to allow for as much interactiveness as possible. </p>
